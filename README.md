Mooc.fi solutions I've come up with.  As of 07/05/2021 I am still working through the course.  I will upload full parts at a time.
I didn't plan on adding this to GitHub so I didn't plan to name things according to the exercise, nor have the exercise instructions included in the codebase.
If you login to the program, you can see each exercise and the instructions that led to the code I wrote.  Hope you enjoy :)
